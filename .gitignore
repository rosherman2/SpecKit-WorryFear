# iOS specific
# Ignore the entire ios folder since it's Flutter-generated
# We have no custom iOS code for this project

!ios/.gitignore

# If we add custom iOS code later, we can be more selective:
# !ios/Runner/
# But for now, it's all generated by Flutter

# Android specific
# Ignore the entire android folder since it's Flutter-generated
# We have no custom Android code for this project

!android/.gitignore

# If we add custom Android code later, we can be more selective:
